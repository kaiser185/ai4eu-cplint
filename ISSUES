OPEN:

- images logtalk etc. (with executable built by save/1) don't seem to
  have terminal completion.  Clues: prolog_flag(tty_control),
  --{no-}tty command line flag.

CLOSED:

- cplint image doesn't have shared libraries linked.
  FIX: in save.pl, use 'foreign(save)'.

- logtalk introduces op(200, fy, (?)), which is not digested by
  cplint.  Workaround: undefine before loading cplint, redefine after
  (being used in cplint container).  Needs better fix.

- need to connect local directory to /root/data in logtalk and cplint
  containers.
